      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>It is how I would like to describe my music interest. While I will say the majority is a concoction of hip-hop and R&B, I have a little bit of all genres such as EDM, country, classic rock, and alternative. Additionally, this website is meant to showcase what I think could be useful to expand anyoneâ€™s musical interests, and I hope you will be able to do just that!

      <h2>The Playlist</h2>
      <p>My primary playlist, A Little Bit of Everything, is a playlist I created 4 years ago, when I really started to expand my music interests. The playlist currently has 4,406 songs, which comes out to about 11 days worth of listening, and hopefully will entertain you occasionally. Furthermore, the playlist is in chronological order from the date that I added them. The beginning represents my interest in music at the age of 14; the end represents my interest in music at the age of 18. In addition to, the spotify player below only goes through the first 100 songs, so I encourage visiting the entire website and trying to go through shuffle!
