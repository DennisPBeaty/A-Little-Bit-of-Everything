      <h2>Who is Childish Gambino?</h2>
<p>The American star was born in Lancaster, California, on September 25, 1983, to a former postal worker (father) and a former daycare worker (mother). Glover who has a brother, a sister, and two adopted siblings, was raised in Stone Mountain, GA by parents who were both Jehovah’s Witnesses.

He attended Stephenson High School, the DeKalb School of the Arts in Georgia and subsequently the New York Tisch School of the Arts where he graduated in 2006 with a degree in dramatic writing.

<p>The song "Heartbeat" by Childish Gambino describes one of his complicated relationships. Bino finds himself in a "serious" relationship with a girl he doesn't seem to have much care or affection for. Yet, a previous lover, the one he claims is "the one," is the one who he casually hits up and hangs out with  on occasion. Therefore, Bino is stuck wanting the exact opposite of what he has and does his best to try to get the girl known as the one.</p>
<p>The album "Because of the Internet" by Childish Gambino is meant to focus on how social media and the internet affects social interaction. It is home to many classics of Childish Gambino such as: "The Worst Guys", "Sweatpants", and "3005" and carries a variety of sounds in between pop and hip-hop. </p>
