<p>Kyle Harvey is an American singer-songwriter and rapper. He is more popular by his stage name and mononym Kyle (stylized as KYLE). Over the years, he has also used other stage names, including K.i.D, SuperDuperKyle, King Wavy, and Kidd Kash. A California native, Kyle started singing when he was six years old and by the time he was in elementary school, he was already writing songs and composing music for them. At 13, he began to rap after getting inspired by Kid Cudi's ‘Man on the Moon’. Kyle released his first mixtape in 2010, titled ‘Senior Year,’ and has since put out two more mixtapes. In 2011, his first album ‘FxL’, was released. Subsequently, ‘K.i.D.’ was put out in 2012, ‘Beautiful Loser’ in 2013, and ‘Smyle’ in 2015. In May 2018, Kyle released his debut studio album ‘Light of Mine’. Aspiring to be “the John Lennon of Rap”, Kyle has emerged as one of the most promising stars in the music industry in recent years. He has significant numbers of followers on various platforms of social media. </p>

<p>This song is a love song about Kyle's girlfriend of 6 years, Jadaboo. Kyle describes the effects she has on him and the process by which they became a couple.</p>
<p>Kyle’s sophomore album, Smyle was released on October 2, 2015, which happens to be World Smile Day.

The Cali-based rapper has called it upbeat, 90’s style rap, with references to video games and old forms of media, like his freshman project, Beautiful Loser. It also has a simple message to Smyle.

The name of the album is the word ‘smile’ fused with ‘Kyle’: Smyle.
