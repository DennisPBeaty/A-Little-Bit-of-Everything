      <h2>Who is J. Cole?</h2>
<p>Jermaine Lamarr Cole (born January 28, 1985), known professionally as J. Cole, is a German-born American rapper, singer, songwriter and record producer. Born on a military base in Germany but raised in Fayetteville, North Carolina, Cole initially gained recognition as a rapper following the release of his debut mixtape, The Come Up, in early 2007. Intent on further pursuing a solo career as a rapper, he went on to release two additional mixtapes, The Warm Up and Friday Night Lights after signing to Jay-Z's Roc Nation imprint in 2009.

Cole released his debut studio album, Cole World: The Sideline Story, in 2011. It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, and was soon certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). His next two releases, 2013's Born Sinner and 2014's 2014 Forest Hills Drive, received mostly positive reviews from critics, and both were certified platinum in the United States. The latter earned him his first Grammy Award nomination for Best Rap Album. In December 2016, Cole released his fourth studio album 4 Your Eyez Only. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified platinum in April 2017. His fifth album, KOD, was released in April 2018. The album debuted atop the Billboard 200, making it his fifth album to reach number one on the chart.

Self-taught on piano, Cole also acts as a producer alongside his hip-hop career, producing singles for artists such as Kendrick Lamar and Janet Jackson, as well as handling the majority of the production in his own projects. He has also developed other ventures, including Dreamville Records, as well as a non-profit organization called the Dreamville Foundation. In January 2015, Cole decided to house single mothers rent-free at his childhood home in Fayetteville, North Carolina. J. Cole is also a past member of the alternative hip hop collective All City Chess Club. </p>

<p>The song "Love Yourz" by J. Cole features a theme of appreciation. Throughout his journeys within the music industry, J. Cole learned to have contentness with whatever phase of his life he happened to be in. When he was poor, he had the love and support of his family. When he was without his loving family, he prospered in his music career and became rich. That being said, Cole tries his best to show the listener to appreciate what they currently posses within their life. Afterall, "there is no such thing as a life thats better than yours."</p>
<p>The album "4 Your Eyez Only" tells the story of J. Cole and his best childhood friend, who he shared a parelled life with. Their lives move in similar directions, such as: finding their true loves, becoming fathers, and beginning their careers at the same time. However, Cole's career would be started by attending college, while trying his hardest to make a name in the rap industry. Unlike Jeremiah, Cole's best friend began selling illegal drugs and was, eventually, murdered in a shoot out. Cole fills this entire album with valuable lessons and themes for his audience, the daughters of Cole and his best friend. This is where the title "4 Your Eyez Only" originated from.</p>
